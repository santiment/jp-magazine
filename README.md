# Santiment JP Magazine landing page

This is the source for [`Magazine Landing Page`](https://jp-magazine.santiment.net).

## Running locally

If you have yarn you can run the app simply:

```bash
yarn
yarn start
```

This is going to run the app on port 8000, so [`localhost:8000`](http://localhost:8000) should be accessible.
